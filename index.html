                <p>This walkthrough goes into great detail on what you can/should do between missions—the Free part of Freelancer. 
                    Except for a few points in the story you have a fair amount of freedom.</p>

                <p>Before you take off, you can add another Justice Mk I to the ship with your starting $500. Or you could save your money to buy bigger guns later; you only get 30% of the purchase price back 
                    when you sell equipment. If you don't buy the gun,</p>

                <p>When you get to Pittsburgh, you again have the option of upgrading your ship. You now have enough money for a Class 2 shield. Pittsburgh sells Civilian laser weapons,
                     which are slightly cheaper and weaker than the Liberty laser</p>

            <h3>Without Limits</h3>
            <p>When you're done, you're at liberty for the first time to do whatever you want. As the game says, fly some bar missions, haul cargo, or mine. Since you're still stuck in
                 New York system, the trading opportunities are pretty limited.
                You're now Level 2, so you can buy Class 3.</p>

            <p>You'll want to upgrade your ship as soon as possible. Your best option is the Liberty Defender heavy fighter, available from Battleship Missouri. Another option is the Pirate Bloodhound light fighter, available from Rochester Base. If you want to trade (or pirate), you could buy a Rhino freighter; it has more gun mounts than any fighter, and freighter shields are the strongest. Unfortunately,
                 its gun batteries are pretty weak, it doesn't take Class 4</p>
